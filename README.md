# âœ¨ Introduction

Kitsunetsuki is the oldest, longest running occult Discord bot. Created on May 21 2017, she has served many peoples divination needs over the years. She is created by me: Ahri Fox.

# âœ¨ F.A.Q

## Q: How can I use her?

On Discord, duh. [Heres the link to add her to a discord you own](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=%20315826602187554816&scope=bot&permissions=314432). You can also join the [support discord](https://discord.gg/NVFJKgG) and then DM her, or use her in one of the command channels.

## Q: What is she written-in?

She is written in ASnake *(see [the website, asnake.org](asnake.org) for more info)*, which is a language I created. ASnake compiles to Python and Cython, though for Kitsu I typically run her using [Pyston](https://github.com/pyston/pyston) instead of CPython. She uses the [disnake](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/) library for all the Discord related stuff.

## Q: Whats kind of system does she run on?

She runs a Debian VPS hosted by [GalaxyGate](https://galaxygate.net/), with 4GB of ram. It costs 10$ a month, so anything above that on the Patreon goes towards either me, or for months that go below that number (has happened before), or rarely for Kitsu related artwork.

I also run Kitsunetsuki Classic locally on a dual [CPU Intel Xeon E5-2648L v3](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/81901/intel-xeon-processor-e52648l-v3-30m-cache-1-80-ghz/specifications.html) which has 48(!) threads, and 32 GB of RAM. This is quite beefy specs for a Discord bot, but this is a spare PC I have in the garage for other purposes, acting as a pseudo server sometimes. This PC runs off **SOLAR POWER!** So if you use this version of the bot, you're being green. I don't run the main bot on this machine because of reliability; sometimes I might need to restart the PC for something stupid, or the power might go out and there not be any battery left, etc... Also the connection is worse than the VPS.

## Q: What the heck is Kitsunetsuki Classic?

She is the old version of the bot written in Python (not ASnake) for the discord.py library. In 2021, two big changes were happening on Discord. One, Discord was requiring bots to verify, and removing the ability for text commands unless they needed it, I had to switch over to the slash command system, which shes uses now.
Two, the maintainer of discord.py was qutting, meaning I had to find a new library to host her with. That ended up being disnake. In the end, the creator continued working on discord.py, and a lot of bots got text permissions anyway. So I got pranked.

Regardless, Kitsunetsuki is a frozen-in-time version of the bot that only uses text commands. I don't really maintain or fix things on it typically, except for horoscopes. It  is only limited to 100 servers by Discord, so I only offer it to patrons. However, you can access is for free if you join the support discord, and interact with it via DM.

## Q: Is Kitsunetsuki Open Source?
No. Maybe one day. I mean if I did, would you use ASnake? Actually that sounds tempting. This page is currently just to host the ToS required by Discord for their Discovery program.

## Q: Is Kitsunetsuki Accurate?

I as the developer take a stance of "tool" over "tell", meaning I do not guarantee the accuracy, and try not to prescribe a meaning to the results of the commands beyond what is commonly agreed upon. It is up to you to use Kitsunetsuki as a tool in ways you see fit.

## Q: Can I add X tarot deck to the bot?

Only if it is digitally available in some form. It has to have all the card images online somewhere.
If you want the highest chance of the deck being added, you can retrieve all the cards yourself.

Number them from 0 (Fool) all the way to 77 (King of Pentacles). If a card is missing you can skip it ie 0, 1 , 5, 6, 7
Strength should be 8, Justice 11.
The order of minor arcana should be Wands -> Cups -> Swords -> Pentacles
Then just zip up the folder and send to me, and I'll most likely add it if I like the look of it.

If it is not available online, then it would be wonderful if you took photos of the deck yourself (please not with your phone unless its high quality).

If you do all this, contact me via Discord and we'll sort it out.

## Q: How can I support you?

~~Just queue as a support, I'll be the ADC/APC.~~ You can sub to [Kitsunetsuki's Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/c/KitsunetsukiDiscord)
You can also send money to [my PayPal](https://paypal.me/ahrifoxy) if you want to skip Patreon fees or do a one time payment.
If you are a creepy paranoid person, or a fool who think you will earn money through crypto, you can send me XMR:

# âœ¨ Terms of Service

There are none, I've never banned anyone from the bot. That said, I reserve the right to ban anyone from it. The bot may stop service at any time.

# âœ¨ Privacy Policy

I store server IDs and user IDs when a server or user has created a setting, such as tarot bans.
I may see username, server, and channel in the logs when a command errors in some way, for debugging purposes. I don't really pay attention though.
